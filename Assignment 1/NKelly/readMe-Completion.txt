I would say that the project has around 75% completness. The last thing to be added was letting the clients actually play together. Clients are handled very well and so are thier connections, all the server functionality is there other than parsing of messages to send to specific clients. I planned to make the clinets parse messages in order to handle where the information goes and other game information like shooting. The observer pattern wasn't used also.
